          My first priority as your Councillor, will be addressing future rate rises for all residents. I understand the
          importance of fostering a culture of accountability, to best steward your public resources. I believe I am
          uniquely positioned to challenge and guide the City’s resource allocation approach, by leveraging my
          experience working in international consultancy firms, government, technology start-ups, and ASX-listed
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that a variety of factors go into what makes our City a great place to live - affordability,
          livability, our natural and built environment, the social networks, and economic opportunities. Therefore,
          other key areas that I will focus on will include - improving community safety, encouraging the growth of our
          urban tree canopy, sustainable strategies to tackle road safety, creating inclusive spaces within the City,
          and establishing multi-use spaces to build valuable shared experiences for everyone who calls the City of
          Melville home.
        </p>

          I am running to be your local Councillor because I am passionate about our community. Our ward, and the
          greater City of Melville, is an amazing place. I know I’m not the only one that values all that our community
          has to offer - our world-famous jacaranda trees, being able to safely cycle along the beautiful Swan River
          across the Canning Bridge into the CBD, and enjoying the local produce on offer at the many small businesses
          dotted throughout the City. These often overlooked everyday experiences are what I want to champion and
          protect for all current and future residents.

        <p>
          I have key skills in external financial audit for ASX 200 companies, producing comprehensive asset
          management plans, financial management systems, and business analysis and advice. My specialised technical
          abilities as a Chartered Accountant will allow me to critically scrutinise key areas of the Council’s
          financial management, such as the Long term Financial Plan and the Asset Management Plan.
